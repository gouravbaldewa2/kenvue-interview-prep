## Candidate Context: Career Arc & Fit Assessment

### Career trajectory (11+ years)

| Period | Role | Company | Why it matters for this interview |
|---|---|---|---|
| 04/2023 – Present | Marketing Manager, Sprite | Coca-Cola India | $1B hydration-adjacent brand; regional strategy for India + South-West Asia; **Sprite Zero test-and-learn launch**; **Rapid Hydration product launch blueprint** |
| 07/2021 – 03/2023 | Brand Manager, Ethnic Categories | Coca-Cola India | **RimZim reformulation** (2.2X GP improvement); region-specific GTM; literally conceptualised a "Rapid Hydration product launch blueprint" |
| 03/2020 – 07/2021 | Marketing Manager | Chai Point | **Startup experience**; built 0→1 packaged foods business across D2C and e-commerce; agile team of 4; scaled to INR 30M |
| 06/2019 – 01/2020 | Director Sales | Merhaki Foods & Nutrition | **Food & Nutrition startup** (acquired by GlobalBees); expanded categories from concept to shelf; built omni-channel distribution |
| 11/2017 – 10/2019 | National Key Accounts Manager | Colgate Palmolive | **Consumer health-adjacent** (oral care); launched Colgate Vedshakti; INR 1200+ Mn revenue; Joint Business Plans |
| 07/2016 – 10/2017 | Asst Manager, Shopper Development | Colgate Palmolive | Trade strategy; field force management (40+ merchandisers); East India market development |

### Strengths to lean into — she's MUCH stronger than a typical "beverage-only" candidate

- **Hydration category experience is LITERAL, not just adjacent** — She conceptualised a "Rapid Hydration product launch blueprint" at Coca-Cola. This is the single most important line on her resume for this interview. She needs to expand on this extensively.
- **Proven test-and-learn / pilot-to-scale muscle** — Sprite Zero: launched in 6 cities, achieved 23% repeat purchase rate, then enabled national rollout. This is *exactly* what the JD asks for under "Incubation & Commercialization."
- **Startup + big company hybrid** — Chai Point (built packaged foods 0→1) and Merhaki Foods (concept-to-shelf in nutrition) give her the "start-up energy" the JD explicitly calls out. Most candidates from large FMCG companies won't have this.
- **Reformulation experience** — RimZim reformulation (consumer-centric rethink, 2.2X GP improvement) directly parallels eRZL's reformulation (1.4x more electrolytes, 8x less sugar). She can speak to the art of reformulating a product while improving both consumer appeal and margins.
- **Multi-market strategy** — She's built growth blueprints for India, Nepal, and Bangladesh, and launched Sprite Lemon Mint in Bangladesh (50% first-time consumers). APAC/regional thinking is built in.
- **Sales and trade experience** — The JD requires "direct experience engaging with customers through sales or sales management." She has Director Sales at Merhaki AND National Key Accounts at Colgate. Most marketing candidates don't have this. Highlight it.
- **Consumer health-adjacent experience** — Colgate Palmolive (oral care) + Merhaki (food & nutrition) means she's not a complete stranger to health/wellness categories.
- **P&L scale** — Managed a $1 Bn brand (Sprite), drove INR 1200+ Mn revenue at Colgate. She's operated at serious scale.
- **Rural and Tier 2/3 market expertise** — Pioneered Coca-Cola's first closed-loop rural engagement model (24% engagement rate, 3x benchmark). ORS penetration in rural India is a massive opportunity.

### Gaps to address proactively (narrower than initially assumed)

- **HCP (Healthcare Professional) engagement** — No direct experience with doctors or pharmacists. This is the primary gap. Must address with curiosity and a 30-day learning plan (see Day 4).
- **Regulatory & claims environment** — Consumer health products face FSSAI, drug scheduling, and clinical substantiation requirements that beverages don't. She should acknowledge this and position it as a learning edge, not a blocker.
- **Science-backed product development** — Kenvue's innovation is rooted in clinical evidence (WHO osmolarity standards, Hydra-Activ Technology). Her innovation experience is more consumer-insight-led. The bridge: "I bring the consumer lens; I'm eager to pair it with Kenvue's science infrastructure."

**Important reframe**: Her gaps are narrower than they appear. She has food & nutrition startup experience (Merhaki), consumer health-adjacent experience (Colgate), and literally created a "Rapid Hydration product launch blueprint." The only genuine gap is HCP engagement — and even there, the eRZL side of the portfolio is retail/consumer-led.

# DAY 1: Know the Company, Category & Competition
*Time: ~4-5 hours*

## 1.1 — Kenvue: Company Deep-Dive

### What to study
- Kenvue was spun off from Johnson & Johnson in 2023 as the world's largest pure-play consumer health company
- ~22,000 employees globally; 13 brands in India
- Three segments: **Self-Care**, **Skin Health & Beauty**, **Essential Health**
- India operations: 2 manufacturing sites (Mumbai, Baddi), 1 global R&D center (Mumbai)
- Core values: science-backed, consumer-first, agile, courageous problem-solving

### Key talking points she should internalise
- Kenvue's identity as "start-up energy with big-company muscle" — directly from the JD
- The company is building new categories in India, not just maintaining legacy brands
- The Self-Care division (which this role sits in) is the growth engine

---

## 1.2 — The Hydration Portfolio: ORSL, eRZL, and WHO ORS

### ORSL
- India's #1 Ready-to-Drink (RTD) electrolyte brand for 20+ years
- Pioneered the RTD electrolyte category
- Now repositioned specifically for **diarrheal dehydration**
- WHO ORS variant launched Jan 2025 in RTD format with **Hydra-Activ Technology** (100% WHO osmolarity compliance)
- Available in Apple and Orange flavours
- Addresses a massive public health need: diarrhea is India's 3rd leading cause of death in children under 5; ORS coverage is only 60.6%

### eRZL
- Repositioned for **everyday, non-diarrheal hydration** (heat exhaustion, muscle cramps, fatigue)
- Reformulated: 1.4x more electrolytes, 8x less sugar than previous version
- Contains sodium, potassium, chloride, Vitamin C + real fruit juice
- Targets active lifestyle and wellness-conscious consumers

### Dual-Brand Strategy
- **ORSL** = Medical/clinical hydration (HCP-recommended, pharmacy-led)
- **eRZL** = Lifestyle/everyday hydration (retail-led, occasion-based)
- This is a textbook portfolio segmentation — she should be able to discuss why this matters

---

## 1.3 — Market & Competitive Landscape

### Market size
- India ORS market: ~Rs 1,000 crore and growing rapidly
- Global ORS market: $3.28B in 2024, projected $7.71B by 2033 (CAGR ~10%)
- India electrolyte hydration drinks market growing at ~8.4% CAGR

### Key competitors

| Brand | Company | Positioning | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Electral** | FDC Limited | ORS market leader | >50% market share; legacy pharma brand |
| **Prolyte ORS** | Cipla | Low-calorie WHO ORS | 5x business growth in 3 years |
| **Liquid IV** | Hindustan Unilever | Premium lifestyle hydration | Targeting affluent, active segments |
| **RasKik Gluco Energy** | Reliance Consumer | Mass-market, affordable | Rs 10 single-serve sachets |
| **Fast&Up Reload** | Fast&Up | Sports/fitness hydration | Added magnesium, potassium, Vitamin B12 |
| **Enerzal** | Zydus Wellness | Sports/glucose drink | Low-sugar variants for fitness |

### Market dynamics to discuss
- The Rs 1,000 crore ORS market is being disrupted by mainstream FMCG companies entering what was historically a pharma-dominated space
- Rising heatwaves, fitness culture, and health awareness are expanding the "everyday hydration" occasion beyond illness
- RTD formats are winning over powder sachets for convenience and compliance
- The HCP (Healthcare Professional) channel remains critical for ORS credibility but retail/D2C is growing fast

---

## 1.4 — Day 1 Study Questions (Self-Test)

1. What is Kenvue's dual-brand strategy for hydration and why does it matter?
2. Name 3 competitors and explain how they're positioned differently from ORSL/eRZL
3. What is the size of the addressable market and what's driving growth?
4. What regulatory considerations exist for an ORS product vs. a soft drink like Sprite?
5. Why is the RTD format a strategic advantage for ORSL?

---

---

# DAY 2: Innovation Frameworks & Case Studies
*Time: ~4-5 hours*

## 2.1 — Innovation Leadership Vocabulary

She needs to speak the language of an **Innovation Head**, not just a Marketing Manager. Key concepts to internalise:

### Innovation pipeline management
- **Funnel stages**: Ideation → Concept screening → Prototyping → Pilot → Scale
- **Stage-gate process**: Each stage has clear criteria (consumer desirability, technical feasibility, business viability) before proceeding
- **Kill criteria**: Equally important — when and how do you kill ideas that aren't working?

### Test-and-learn culture
- **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** thinking for consumer health
- **Pilot markets** — launch in 2-3 cities before national rollout
- **Rapid iteration cycles** — 90-day sprints with clear KPIs
- **Fail fast, learn faster** — be ready with an example of something she killed or pivoted

### Whitespace identification
- **Occasion mapping** — what hydration occasions are unserved? (e.g., post-workout, travel, monsoon illness, children's hydration, elderly care)
- **Need-state segmentation** — medical vs. lifestyle vs. performance vs. preventive
- **Adjacent category analysis** — what can Kenvue learn from functional beverages, supplements, or wellness brands?

### Brand architecture
- **House of brands vs. branded house** — Kenvue uses a house of brands (ORSL and eRZL are distinct)
- **Portfolio roles** — which brand drives volume, which drives margin, which builds the future?
- **Price-pack architecture** — different formats (RTD, powder, sachets) for different channels and occasions

---

## 2.2 — Likely Interview Questions on Innovation

### Q1: "How would you build an innovation pipeline for the hydration portfolio?"

**Sample direction:**
- Start with consumer insight mining — ethnographic research, social listening, HCP interviews
- Map unmet needs across the hydration occasion spectrum (illness, sports, everyday wellness, travel, children)
- Create a 3-horizon framework:
  - **H1 (0-12 months)**: Line extensions and format innovations on ORSL and eRZL (new flavours, new pack sizes, seasonal variants)
  - **H2 (12-24 months)**: Adjacent innovations (e.g., hydration for children, hydration + immunity, sports-specific formulation)
  - **H3 (24-36 months)**: Breakthrough innovations (e.g., personalised hydration, tech-enabled hydration tracking, new delivery formats like gummies or dissolvable strips)
- Build a stage-gate process with clear go/no-go criteria at each stage
- Establish an innovation council with R&D, supply chain, regulatory, and commercial stakeholders

### Q2: "Tell me about a time you identified a whitespace opportunity and brought it to market."

**Sample direction — she has MULTIPLE strong options here. Pick the best one:**

**Option A — Sprite Zero (strongest for this role):**
- **Situation**: Identified a gap in Coca-Cola India's sparkling portfolio for health-conscious consumers who wanted Sprite without the sugar
- **Insight**: Consumer data showed growing demand for zero-sugar variants, but no Indian pilot existed
- **Action**: Spearheaded product development and launch in 6 cities as a test market
- **Result**: 23% repeat purchase rate — proving product-market fit — which then enabled national rollout
- **Bridge**: "This is exactly the pilot-to-scale muscle the Kenvue role requires. I'd apply the same rigour — test in 2-3 cities, measure trial and repeat, then scale what works."

**Option B — Sprite At-Home occasion (strong for consumer insight):**
- **Situation**: Sprite was overwhelmingly an out-of-home, impulse purchase brand. Home consumption was a massive untapped occasion
- **Insight**: Used consumer research to identify the At-Home hydration gap
- **Action**: Developed and executed Sprite's first At-Home campaign
- **Result**: 1.2X increase in Household Penetration vs. last year in H2'24
- **Bridge**: "Identifying new consumption occasions is directly transferable. For eRZL, I'd map every hydration occasion — sports, travel, office, monsoon — and build activation plans around each."

**Option C — Chai Point packaged foods (strongest for 0→1):**
- **Situation**: Chai Point was a tea retail chain with no packaged food business
- **Action**: Built an agile team of 4 and implemented end-to-end product, sourcing, and distribution to launch packaged foods across D2C and 5+ e-commerce channels
- **Result**: Launched 4 sub-categories with limited budget, scaling revenue to INR 30M
- **Bridge**: "This was true 0→1 innovation — no existing playbook, limited resources, building from scratch. That's the exact energy the JD describes."

### Q3: "How would you approach launching a new SKU in the hydration category?"

**Sample direction:**
- **Consumer insight**: What unmet need does this address? Validated through quant + qual research
- **Technical feasibility**: Work with R&D on formulation; ensure regulatory compliance (FSSAI, drug scheduling if applicable)
- **Commercial viability**: Price-pack architecture, channel strategy (pharmacy vs. GT vs. MT vs. D2C), margin analysis
- **Pilot plan**: Select 2-3 test markets, define success metrics (trial rate, repeat rate, velocity), timeline for read
- **Scale plan**: If pilot succeeds, national rollout playbook — supply chain readiness, trade activation, media plan
- **HCP strategy**: For any health-claim product, HCP recommendation is a credibility multiplier — plan detailing/sampling with doctors and pharmacists

### Q4: "The electrolyte market is getting crowded with FMCG players entering. How would you defend and grow the hydration portfolio?"

**Sample direction:**
- **Double down on science credibility** — ORSL's WHO compliance and Hydra-Activ Technology is a moat that lifestyle brands can't easily replicate
- **HCP channel as a defensible advantage** — Doctor recommendations are the strongest purchase trigger for health products; invest in medical detailing
- **Occasion ownership** — Own the "illness recovery" occasion (ORSL) and the "smart daily hydration" occasion (eRZL) distinctly
- **Innovation velocity** — Stay ahead with new formats, formulations, and consumer experiences
- **Price-pack strategy** — Ensure availability across price points (Rs 10 sachet to Rs 50 RTD bottle) to compete with both Electral and Reliance

### Q5: "What's the difference between innovation in beverages and innovation in consumer healthcare?"

**Sample direction (critical question — she MUST prepare this well):**
- **Regulatory complexity**: Consumer health products need scientific substantiation for claims; beverage innovation is largely taste/format-driven
- **HCP influence**: In healthcare, doctors and pharmacists are a critical channel; beverages don't have this intermediary
- **Trust and credibility**: Consumer health brands are built on trust in efficacy, not just taste preference. Science-backed claims > emotional advertising
- **Speed vs. rigour**: Beverages can iterate faster (new flavour in months); healthcare innovation needs clinical validation, regulatory approval, and safety testing
- **But also — and this is where she differentiates herself**: "I've actually worked across the spectrum. At Coca-Cola, I did taste-led beverage innovation with Sprite Zero and Sprite Lemon Mint. At Merhaki Foods & Nutrition, I was in a health-adjacent category — expanding food and nutrition products from concept to shelf. At Colgate, I launched Vedshakti, which had Ayurvedic health claims. I understand the difference between selling refreshment and selling efficacy. And at Coca-Cola, I literally conceptualised a Rapid Hydration product launch blueprint. My trajectory has been moving steadily toward exactly this intersection of consumer insight and health-focused innovation."

---

## 2.3 — Case Studies to Reference

Study these briefly to have ready examples:

1. **Liquid IV (HUL)** — How a premium hydration brand entered India through the lifestyle/fitness angle. What worked, what didn't?
2. **Cipla Prolyte** — How a pharma company achieved 5x growth by making ORS more consumer-friendly
3. **Eno (Haleon)** — A consumer health brand in India that successfully bridged pharmacy + retail channels (good parallel for ORSL)
4. **Glucon-D (Zydus)** — A legacy hydration/energy brand that faces disruption from new entrants. What can ORSL learn from its journey?

**Her own case studies (more powerful than external ones):**

5. **Sprite Zero pilot-to-national** — A textbook test-and-learn case. She should be able to walk through the entire funnel: insight → hypothesis → pilot design → metrics → go/no-go → scale plan
6. **RimZim reformulation** — A consumer-insight-driven reformulation that improved both consumer appeal and GP. Directly parallels eRZL's reformulation
7. **Chai Point packaged foods** — A 0→1 business build at a startup. Team, product, sourcing, D2C, e-commerce — all from scratch
8. **Colgate Vedshakti launch** — Her closest experience to consumer health innovation. Health claims, credibility-building, Modern Trade traction

---

## 2.4 — Day 2 Study Questions (Self-Test)

1. Walk through a 3-horizon innovation framework for Kenvue's hydration portfolio
2. What's the difference between brand management and innovation leadership? Give 3 specific examples
3. How would you set up a test-and-learn pilot for a new hydration product?
4. Name 2 whitespace opportunities in India's hydration market and explain why they're attractive
5. How does HCP engagement change the innovation process vs. pure consumer brands?

# DAY 3: Bridging Narratives — Your Full Career to Kenvue
*Time: ~4-5 hours*

## 3.1 — The Core Narrative She Must Craft

The interviewer's unspoken question: **"You come from soft drinks. Why should we trust you to lead innovation in consumer healthcare?"**

**Her real answer is stronger than she thinks.** She doesn't come from "just soft drinks." She comes from hydration innovation, food & nutrition startups, consumer health (Colgate), and large-scale FMCG — across both big companies and scrappy startups. The narrative must convey this breadth.

### Her answer framework (practice this until it's natural):

> "Three things about my career make me the right fit for this role — and they might not be obvious from my current title alone.
>
> First, **I've already worked on hydration innovation.** At Coca-Cola, I conceptualised a Rapid Hydration product launch blueprint — identifying distribution channels, marketing strategies, and activation plans in collaboration with the global network. Sprite is a $1 billion hydration-adjacent brand, and I've spent years understanding thirst occasions, seasonal demand, and the science of consumer choice at the point of purchase.
>
> Second, **I've built things from zero — not just managed existing brands.** At Chai Point, I built a packaged foods business from scratch — team of 4, no playbook, launching across D2C and e-commerce, scaling to INR 30M. At Merhaki Foods & Nutrition, I expanded categories from concept to shelf in food and nutrition. This "start-up energy with big-company muscle" that your JD describes? I've literally lived both halves of it.
>
> Third, **I bring a test-and-learn discipline with hard proof.** Sprite Zero — I piloted it in 6 cities, measured a 23% repeat purchase rate to prove product-market fit, and then enabled the national rollout. That is the exact incubation-to-commercialisation playbook this role demands.
>
> What I'm eager to learn is the HCP dimension — engaging doctors and pharmacists, understanding clinical substantiation, and building the trust that science-backed health brands require. But even here, I'm not starting from zero — I launched Colgate Vedshakti (an Ayurvedic health-claim product) and I've worked in food & nutrition. The gap is real but narrower than it appears, and I have a plan to close it in my first 30 days."

---

## 3.2 — Eight STAR Stories to Prepare (Mapped to Specific Resume Bullets)

She should prepare 8 structured stories using the **STAR method** (Situation, Task, Action, Result). Each story is mapped to a specific JD requirement AND a specific resume bullet.

### Story 1: Pilot-to-scale innovation (maps to "Incubation & Commercialization") — HER #1 STORY

**Resume source**: *"Spearheaded Sprite Zero product development & launch in 6 cities, achieving a 23% repeat purchase rate, which demonstrated product-market fit and enabled national rollout."*

- **S**: Coca-Cola India had no zero-sugar Sprite variant. Health-conscious consumers were underserved in the sparkling category.
- **T**: Lead the product development and pilot launch to test viability before committing to national scale.
- **A**: Worked cross-functionally on formulation, selected 6 pilot cities, designed the measurement framework (trial rate, repeat rate, velocity), managed the GTM.
- **R**: 23% repeat purchase rate — strong signal of product-market fit. Enabled the national rollout decision.
- **Bridge to Kenvue**: "This is the exact incubation-to-commercialisation playbook the JD describes. I've done it. At Kenvue, I'd add the science validation and HCP layer to this process."
- **Key probe she should prepare for**: "What were the kill criteria? At what repeat rate would you NOT have rolled out nationally?"

### Story 2: Hydration innovation blueprint (maps to "Innovation Leadership") — HER SECRET WEAPON

**Resume source**: *"Conceptualized the Rapid Hydration product launch blueprint, identifying key distribution channels, marketing strategies & activation plan by collaborating with global network team."*

- She MUST expand on this in detail. What was the brief? What consumer insight drove it? What channels did she identify? How did the global collaboration work? What was the outcome?
- **Bridge to Kenvue**: "I've literally built a hydration innovation launch blueprint before. The category is different, but the strategic muscle — consumer insight, channel strategy, activation planning, global collaboration — is identical."
- **Key probe she should prepare for**: "What would you change about that blueprint if you were designing it for a consumer health product like ORSL?"

### Story 3: Consumer-centric reformulation (maps to "Consumer-Centric Decision Making")

**Resume source**: *"Reformulated RimZim with consumer centric thinking while improving system GP by 2.2X."*

- **S**: RimZim (Coca-Cola's jeera-based drink) was underperforming. Needed a consumer-centric rethink.
- **T**: Reformulate the product to better resonate with consumers while also improving profitability.
- **A**: Deep-dove into consumer drivers for jeera consumption, used insights to reshape the product and brand proposition.
- **R**: 2.2X improvement in gross profit + 5% brand awareness uplift.
- **Bridge to Kenvue**: "This directly parallels what Kenvue did with eRZL — reformulating to be 1.4x more electrolytes, 8x less sugar. I understand the art of reformulating for consumer relevance AND commercial health simultaneously."

### Story 4: Building from zero at a startup (maps to "Start-Up Energy, Big Company Muscle")

**Resume source**: *"Built & led an agile team of 4 & implemented end-to-end on Product, Sourcing & distribution launching Chai Point's packaged foods in Direct to Customer & 5+ e-commerce channels. Launched 4 sub-categories with limited budget, scaling revenue to INR 30M."*

- **S**: Chai Point was a tea retail chain with no packaged food business. Zero infrastructure, zero playbook.
- **T**: Build the entire packaged foods vertical from scratch.
- **A**: Hired and led a team of 4. Owned end-to-end: product development, sourcing, distribution. Launched across D2C and 5+ e-commerce channels.
- **R**: 4 sub-categories launched. Revenue scaled to INR 30M. All with limited budget.
- **Bridge to Kenvue**: "The JD says 'start-up energy with big-company muscle.' I've literally done both — Chai Point was the startup, Coca-Cola is the big company. I know how to operate in both worlds."

### Story 5: Concept-to-shelf in food & nutrition (maps to "Cross-Functional Collaboration")

**Resume source**: *"Expanded categories from concept to shelf across Tea and Chocolate" (Merhaki Foods & Nutrition); "Planned the omni-channel strategy & scaled Merhaki in 10+ customers."*

- **S**: Merhaki was an early-stage food & nutrition company. Categories needed to be built from scratch.
- **T**: Take products from concept to shelf and build the distribution engine.
- **A**: Built omni-channel strategy across e-commerce and large retail. Led 8-member sales team. Achieved 10K+ store distribution.
- **R**: Categories successfully launched. Company later acquired by GlobalBees (validation of the strategy).
- **Bridge to Kenvue**: "I've done concept-to-shelf in food and nutrition — not just in beverages. The cross-functional collaboration with product, supply chain, and retail partners is directly transferable."

### Story 6: Multi-market growth strategy (maps to "Influencing Senior Stakeholders")

**Resume source**: *"Synthesized market research and competitive insights into actionable growth blueprints for Nepal and Bangladesh, resulting in +1.6 share gain in Nepal & +2.7 share gain in Bangladesh"; "Introduced Sprite Lemon Mint during Ramadan in Bangladesh, adding 50% first-time Sprite consumers."*

- **S**: Needed to develop growth strategies for South-West Asian markets with different consumer dynamics.
- **T**: Synthesise research into actionable blueprints that regional leadership would buy into and fund.
- **A**: Led market research, competitive analysis, developed integrated campaigns. For Bangladesh specifically, identified Ramadan as a key occasion and launched a culturally relevant variant (Sprite Lemon Mint).
- **R**: +1.6 share gain in Nepal, +2.7 share gain in Bangladesh, 50% first-time Sprite consumers from the Bangladesh initiative.
- **Bridge to Kenvue**: "This role reports into the Self-Care Director and has visibility to APAC leadership. I've done multi-market strategy before — understanding local nuances, building locally relevant plans, and presenting them to regional stakeholders."

### Story 7: Rural/underserved market penetration (maps to "Scaling new products with measurable impact")

**Resume source**: *"Pioneered Coca-Cola India's first closed-loop rural engagement model in high potential regions, achieving a 24% engagement rate (3x benchmark) and a +16% boost in outlet offtake."*

- **S**: Rural India was underserved by Coca-Cola's existing engagement model. No scalable playbook existed.
- **T**: Pioneer a new model for high-potential rural regions.
- **A**: Designed a closed-loop engagement system (first of its kind at Coca-Cola India). Tested in high-potential regions.
- **R**: 24% engagement rate (3x benchmark), +16% outlet offtake boost.
- **Bridge to Kenvue**: "ORS penetration in rural India is a massive opportunity — coverage is only 60.6% for children under 5. I've built rural engagement models that actually work. This is directly relevant to scaling ORSL in underserved markets."

### Story 8: Launching a health-claim product (maps to "Consumer Healthcare experience")

**Resume source**: *"Launched Colgate Vedshakti & achieved an unheard of 8.9 share in Reliance within year-1."*

- **S**: Colgate was launching Vedshakti — an Ayurvedic oral care product with health positioning. Needed to build traction in Modern Trade.
- **T**: Drive distribution and trial through Reliance channels.
- **A**: Championed Joint Business Plans, designed shopper marketing plans, and activated in-store.
- **R**: 8.9 share in Reliance within Year 1 — "unheard of" for a new launch.
- **Bridge to Kenvue**: "This is the closest I've come to consumer healthcare innovation. Vedshakti had health claims, needed credibility-building, and competed against established brands. The dynamics are very similar to launching a new hydration product in the ORS space."

---

## 3.3 — Reframing Exercise: Marketing Manager → Innovation Head

For every experience she discusses, she should use **innovation language**, not brand management language. Here are specific reframes using her actual resume bullets:

| What her resume says | How to say it in the interview |
|---|---|
| "Directed marketing strategies for Sprite, valued at $1 Bn" | "I led the growth and innovation strategy for a $1 billion hydration brand across India and South-West Asia" |
| "Developed & executed Sprite's 1st At-Home campaign" | "I identified a whitespace consumption occasion — at-home hydration — and designed an experiment to test a new positioning. It delivered 1.2X household penetration growth." |
| "Spearheaded Sprite Zero product development & launch in 6 cities" | "I incubated a new product from concept through pilot to national scale — the exact stage-gate process: 6-city pilot → measure PMF via repeat rate → go/no-go decision → national rollout" |
| "Conceptualized the Rapid Hydration product launch blueprint" | "I built an end-to-end innovation launch blueprint for a hydration product — channel strategy, marketing framework, activation plan — in collaboration with global R&D and commercial teams" |
| "Reformulated RimZim with consumer centric thinking" | "I led a consumer-insight-driven reformulation that simultaneously improved the consumer proposition and expanded margins by 2.2X — the same dual lens that eRZL's reformulation required" |
| "Built & led an agile team of 4 at Chai Point" | "I built a new business vertical from zero at a startup — team, product, sourcing, distribution, D2C channels — and scaled it to INR 30M revenue" |
| "Expanded categories from concept to shelf at Merhaki" | "I've done concept-to-shelf innovation in the food & nutrition space, building categories that didn't exist before" |
| "Launched Colgate Vedshakti, achieving 8.9 share in Reliance" | "I've launched a health-claim consumer product and driven unprecedented trial in Modern Trade — directly relevant to consumer health innovation" |

# DAY 4: Stakeholder, Leadership & Behavioural Questions
*Time: ~4-5 hours*

## 4.1 — Likely Behavioural Questions

### On leadership and influence

**Q: "This role requires influencing senior stakeholders across India and APAC. Give me an example of how you've done this."**

Sample direction:
- Pick an example where she had to get buy-in from someone 2+ levels senior or from a different function
- Show the preparation she did (understanding their priorities, framing the business case in their language)
- Emphasise outcome + relationship building, not just winning the argument

**Q: "How would you build a team culture of experimentation when the organisation may be risk-averse?"**

Sample direction:
- Start small — run low-cost pilots that demonstrate the value of experimentation
- Celebrate learnings, not just successes. Create a "what we learned this quarter" ritual
- Get senior sponsorship by showing ROI of experiments vs. traditional launches
- Reference Coca-Cola's scale: "In a large organisation, I've learned that the best way to drive change is to show results, not just make arguments."

### On cross-functional collaboration

**Q: "Tell me about a time you disagreed with R&D or supply chain and how you resolved it."**

Sample direction:
- Common tension: Marketing wants speed, R&D wants rigour
- Show that she listened first, understood their constraints, and found a creative middle ground
- The resolution should be a win-win, not "I convinced them I was right"

**Q: "How would you work with HCPs (doctors and pharmacists) when you have no prior experience in healthcare?"**

Sample direction (this is the elephant-in-the-room question — but her answer is stronger than most candidates'):
- Acknowledge honestly: "I haven't done medical detailing or direct HCP engagement. I take that gap seriously."
- But reframe: "I'm not starting from zero in health categories. I launched Colgate Vedshakti — an Ayurvedic oral care product with health claims — and drove it to 8.9 share in Reliance within Year 1. I worked at Merhaki Foods & Nutrition, building food and nutrition categories from concept to shelf. The consumer health-adjacent muscle is there."
- Show a plan: "In my first 30 days, I would embed myself with the medical affairs team — sitting in on HCP interactions, understanding their language, what drives their prescribing behavior, and how they evaluate new products. I'd also study how competitors like Electral and Cipla Prolyte engage HCPs."
- Draw parallels: "At Coca-Cola, I worked closely with bottling partners who have their own commercial priorities and decision-making logic. Learning to speak a new stakeholder's language and earn their trust is something I've done before — just in a different context."
- Reference the portfolio: "And the beauty of Kenvue's dual-brand strategy is that eRZL is more consumer/retail-led, which is squarely my strength, while ORSL is more HCP-led. I'd lean on existing medical affairs capability for ORSL while building my own HCP fluency."

### On ambiguity and decision-making

**Q: "You have three innovation concepts. Limited budget. How do you prioritise?"**

Sample direction:
- Define evaluation criteria upfront: consumer desirability (research scores), technical feasibility (R&D input), business viability (market size, margin, speed to market), strategic fit (does it build the portfolio in the right direction?)
- Use a simple scoring matrix, but don't over-index on analysis — also trust consumer signal and gut
- Recommend phasing: pilot the highest-conviction idea first, keep one in development, park the third
- Show awareness of sunk cost bias: "I'd rather kill two good ideas early than spread resources across three and execute none well."

**Q: "If you joined and realised the current innovation pipeline was weak, what would you do in your first 90 days?"**

Sample direction:
- **Days 1-30**: Listen and learn. Meet every stakeholder (R&D, supply chain, sales, medical affairs, APAC leadership). Understand the current pipeline, what's been tried, what's been killed, and why. Spend time in the field — pharmacies, hospitals, retail stores
- **Days 30-60**: Diagnose. Map the pipeline against a 3-horizon framework. Identify the biggest gaps. Run a rapid consumer insight sprint to validate or challenge existing assumptions
- **Days 60-90**: Act. Present a refreshed innovation roadmap to leadership with clear bets, kill recommendations, and resource asks. Launch the first pilot

## 4.2 — Questions About Motivation & Fit

**Q: "Why Kenvue? Why not stay at Coca-Cola?"**

Sample direction:
- "Coca-Cola taught me world-class brand building at scale. But if you look at my career, there's a pattern — I've always been drawn to building new things. I left corporate to join Chai Point and Merhaki because I wanted to build from zero. I came back to Coca-Cola and my proudest work has been the new things: Sprite Zero, the At-Home occasion, the rural engagement model, the Rapid Hydration blueprint."
- "This role is the natural next step in that trajectory. It's full-time innovation leadership, in a category I care about — hydration — with a mandate to build from the ground up. And it adds something I deeply want: building products that improve health outcomes for millions of Indian families."
- "I'm not leaving Coca-Cola because I'm unhappy. I'm running toward an opportunity that combines everything I've done — and adds purpose."
- **Do NOT badmouth Coca-Cola.** Frame it as "running toward something," not "running away."

**Q: "What does innovation mean to you?"**

Sample direction:
- "Innovation is solving a real consumer problem in a way that creates sustainable business value."
- "It's not just about new products — it's about new occasions, new formats, new channels, new business models."
- "Great innovation requires three things: a genuine consumer insight, the courage to test and iterate, and the discipline to scale what works and kill what doesn't."

**Q: "Where do you see yourself in 3-5 years?"**

Sample direction:
- "Leading a broader portfolio beyond hydration — perhaps across Kenvue's Self-Care division in India or taking on a regional APAC innovation mandate."
- Connect it to the JD: the role promises "fast-track growth" and "visibility with senior leadership in India and APAC."

## 5.2 — "Killer" Questions She Might Not Expect

These are harder, and she should have at least a directional answer:

**"What consumer health trends do you think will shape the hydration category in the next 5 years?"**

Directions: Personalised nutrition, functional hydration (hydration + immunity, hydration + gut health), tech-enabled health monitoring, premiumisation of everyday health, climate-driven demand (heatwaves increasing need), shift from treatment to prevention

**"If I gave you Rs 5 crore and said 'build something new in hydration' — what would you build?"**

Directions: Define the consumer problem first. Perhaps: "Children's hydration" — a massive unmet need. Indian parents worry about dehydration in kids but current ORS products are medicinal-tasting. A child-friendly hydration product with fun flavours, trusted science, and an HCP endorsement. Pilot in 3 cities. Measure trial + repeat.

**"How would you convince a skeptical R&D team to fast-track a concept that consumers love but is technically challenging?"**

Directions: Show empathy for R&D's constraints. Bring consumer data to make the case compelling. Propose a phased approach — "Can we do a simpler v1 that captures 70% of the value, while we invest in the harder technical problem for v2?" Frame it as partnership, not pressure.

**"What would you do if your innovation pipeline delivered zero successful launches in Year 1?"**

Directions: First, understand why. Was it consumer rejection, technical failure, or commercial execution? Each diagnosis leads to a different fix. Show resilience and accountability — "I'd own the outcome, diagnose honestly, and rebuild." Also reframe: "In innovation, Year 1 might be about building the pipeline and learning. I'd ensure we have a robust set of pilots running so that Year 2 delivers."

**"How do you think about the tension between science-led and consumer-led innovation?"**

Directions: "They're not in tension — they're in sequence. Start with consumer need, validate with science, then bring it to market with consumer-grade brand building. The magic happens when you have a real scientific advantage that the consumer actually cares about. Hydra-Activ Technology in ORSL is a perfect example — it solves a real scientific problem (osmolarity compliance) that translates into a real consumer benefit (faster, more effective rehydration)."

## 5.3 — Questions She Should Ask the Panel

Prepare 5, ask 2-3 depending on the conversation:

1. **"What does success look like for this role in Year 1?"** — Shows she's outcome-oriented and wants to align expectations early
2. **"How does the India innovation agenda connect to Kenvue's global/APAC hydration strategy?"** — Shows she's thinking beyond India
3. **"What's the current relationship between the hydration portfolio and HCPs, and how do you see that evolving?"** — Shows she's thinking about the HCP gap proactively
4. **"What's been the biggest lesson from recent innovation efforts in this portfolio — what worked and what didn't?"** — Shows humility and a learning mindset
5. **"How does Kenvue think about the balance between innovation speed and regulatory rigour in India?"** — Shows she understands the consumer health nuance

## BONUS: "Tell Me About Yourself" — Scripted 2-Minute Opener

This is usually the first question. It sets the frame for the entire interview. She should NOT just recite her resume. She should tell a **story with a through-line** that makes this role feel like a natural next step.

### Scripted opener (practice until natural — ~2 minutes):

> "I'm a brand and innovation leader with 11 years across large FMCG companies and startups, and a consistent thread through my career has been building and scaling new things in the consumer space.
>
> I started at Colgate Palmolive, where I learned the fundamentals of trade, distribution, and shopper marketing — including launching Colgate Vedshakti, an Ayurvedic health-claim product, to an 8.9 share in Reliance within its first year.
>
> I then deliberately moved to two startups. At Merhaki Foods & Nutrition, I was Director Sales — building omni-channel distribution and expanding new food and nutrition categories from concept to shelf. That company was later acquired by GlobalBees. At Chai Point, I built their packaged foods business from zero — small team, no playbook, 4 sub-categories, INR 30M in revenue. That experience taught me how to innovate with constraints.
>
> I joined Coca-Cola and spent the last five years going deeper into brand strategy and innovation. As Brand Manager for Ethnic Categories, I reformulated RimZim with consumer-centric thinking — improving GP by 2.2X — and conceptualised a Rapid Hydration product launch blueprint. As Marketing Manager for Sprite, I've been directing strategy for a $1 billion brand across India and South-West Asia. My proudest achievement was incubating Sprite Zero — piloting in 6 cities, proving product-market fit with a 23% repeat rate, and enabling the national rollout.
>
> What excites me about this role is that it sits at the intersection of everything I've done — hydration category knowledge, innovation and test-and-learn discipline, startup scrappiness, and large-company scale. And it adds something I'm deeply motivated by: building products that genuinely improve health outcomes. I want to bring consumer-grade brand building to science-backed health innovation, and Kenvue's hydration portfolio is the perfect place to do that."

### Why this structure works:
- **Opens with identity, not job title** — "brand and innovation leader" (frames the conversation)
- **Shows career intentionality** — each move had a reason; it's not a random walk
- **Highlights startup + big company** — directly addresses the JD's "start-up energy, big-company muscle"
- **Namedrops the most relevant experience** — Rapid Hydration blueprint, Sprite Zero pilot, RimZim reformulation, Vedshakti launch
- **Ends with motivation** — why THIS role, why NOW
- **Takes ~2 minutes** — concise enough for an opener, detailed enough to be credible
